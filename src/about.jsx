              ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Iâ€™m Sachin!<br /><br />
              Iâ€™m a curious human running on Python, Java, some oranges, and a dangerously long list of side quests,
              some in code, some in fields or some in video games.<br /><br />
              By day, Iâ€™m a CSE student at VIT Chennai, wrangling AI models, dodging semicolons, and negotiating
              data privacy terms with my Smart Grid (sheâ€™s moody, but secure thanks to AES-RSA ).<br /><br />
              By night, I switch from debugging code to dribbling past defenders on the football field â€”
              both require precision, after all.
            </p><br />
            <div className="build-worlds">
              <p>
                I donâ€™t just build apps â€” I build worlds:<br />
                 â€¢ A Secured Smart City data sharing system with AES-RSA encryption, protecting critical infrastructure end-to-end <br />
                â€¢ A contract farming platform that ensures fair, direct trade between farmers and buyers <br />
                â€¢ An AI-powered storytelling engine where plot twists are generated from comment section chaos powered by drama + NLP <br /><br />
                When Iâ€™m not playing with bytes or boots, Iâ€™m ideating my next hackathon win, building productivity tools with flair,
                or explaining to NPCs why AI is not gonna take our jobs.
                Welcome to my digital dojo - where tech meets storytelling and every project is just one breakpoint away from greatness.<br /><br />
                Letâ€™s connect, before I respawn into another GitHub repo or open-world adventure !
